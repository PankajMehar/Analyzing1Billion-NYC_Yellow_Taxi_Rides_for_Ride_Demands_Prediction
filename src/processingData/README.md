## Download data
Go to http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml and download the data. Put this data with the file into this directory.

## Run the code
Change the file name(input_file) in rmcol_taxi.py, and run rmcol_taxi.py. Then you would get a file named "rmcol_xxxxxx.csv". This code does not run too much time.

Change the file name in process_taxi.py to "rmcol_xxxxxx.csv", which is the output of rmcol_taxi.py. Then run process_taxi.py, which would output a file named "processed_xxxxx.csv"

Be patient, this code would run a long time. Then you would get the final processed data.
